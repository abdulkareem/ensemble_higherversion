# Dissertation Content Draft: Polyp Segmentation with ResUNet++, TransFuse, WDFFNet, and a Learnable Weighted Ensemble on Kvasir-SEG

## 1. Problem Statement

Automatic colorectal polyp segmentation from colonoscopy frames is a dense prediction task where each pixel is classified as polyp or background. Accurate segmentation supports downstream clinical decision-making, including lesion boundary estimation and potential malignancy assessment.

This dissertation investigates three complementary deep models—ResUNet++, TransFuse, and WDFFNet—and a learnable weighted ensemble for robust binary segmentation on Kvasir-SEG.

## 2. Dataset and Preprocessing Protocol

### 2.1 Dataset
Kvasir-SEG contains RGB endoscopic images and corresponding binary masks. Images and masks are loaded from:

- `images/*.jpg`
- `masks/*.jpg` or `masks/*.png`

### 2.2 Unified Preprocessing
To ensure fair comparison across architectures, all models use an identical data pipeline:

1. Resize image and mask to **512 × 512**.
2. Normalize RGB images with ImageNet statistics:
   - mean = (0.485, 0.456, 0.406)
   - std = (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)
3. Convert mask to float and scale to [0, 1].
4. Binarize mask with threshold 0.5.

### 2.3 Splitting Strategy
Data is shuffled with fixed seed and split into train/validation/test subsets using reproducible random splitting.

## 3. Architecture Details

## 3.1 ResUNet++ (Wrapper-based Integration)

ResUNet++ is imported from the original source implementation via dynamic module loading to preserve architectural fidelity. The wrapper:

- instantiates `build_resunetplusplus()` from the external file,
- accepts 3-channel 512×512 input,
- forces output to 1-channel 512×512 using bilinear interpolation when needed.

This solves practical output-size mismatch without modifying the original core architecture.

### Architectural motivation
ResUNet++ combines residual learning with multi-scale U-Net style encoding-decoding and skip pathways, improving boundary-aware segmentation over plain U-Net in challenging low-contrast medical imagery.

## 3.2 TransFuse (CNN + Lightweight Transformer-style Dual Stream)

The TransFuse implementation uses two feature extractors:

- CNN stream: `efficientnet_b0` (features-only),
- second stream: `mobilenetv3_large_100` (features-only),

with BiFusion blocks at multiple semantic scales:

- Deep fusion: 256 channels,
- Mid fusion: 128 channels,
- Shallow fusion: 64 channels.

Fused deep/mid features are upsampled to shallow spatial resolution, concatenated, and projected to one-channel logits with a 1×1 convolution.

Finally, prediction is upsampled/interpolated to fixed 512×512 output.

### Why TransFuse helps
The dual-path design mixes local texture cues from convolutional features with broader semantic representations, reducing missed polyps and improving context robustness.

---

## 3.3 WDFFNet (Dual Backbone + Weighted Fusion + Attention Decoder)

WDFFNet integrates two backbones:

- EfficientNet-B0 branch,
- ResNet-50 branch,

using matched projection layers and per-scale **WeightedFusion** units. Each fusion output is refined by **Object-Aware Attention**:

1. Channel attention via global pooling and bottleneck MLP-like convs,
2. Spatial attention via max/avg channel maps and 3×3 conv.

Decoder design:

- progressive transposed-convolution upsampling,
- skip concatenation with fused encoder features,
- staged 3×3 refinement,
- final 1×1 projection to binary logits.

Output is interpolated to 512×512.

### Why WDFFNet helps
Combining two heterogeneous encoders improves feature diversity. Weighted fusion and attention increase saliency for small or ambiguous lesions.

## 4. Ensemble Architecture

A learnable weighted ensemble is constructed from frozen base-model outputs:

1. Generate logits from ResUNet++, TransFuse, WDFFNet.
2. Stack into 3-channel prediction tensor.
3. Pass through a lightweight ensemble head:
   - Conv(3→16, 3×3) + ReLU,
   - Conv(16→3, 1×1),
   - Softmax across model-channel dimension.
4. Weighted sum of stacked predictions gives final fused map.

Mathematically:

\[
\hat{Y} = \sum_{m=1}^{3} w_m(X) \cdot P_m(X), \quad \sum_m w_m(X)=1
\]

where \(P_m\) are base-model predictions and \(w_m\) are input-adaptive softmax weights.

This is superior to plain averaging because contribution weights adapt spatially and sample-wise.

## 5. Loss Function and Optimization

All base models are trained independently with:

- **Adam** optimizer, learning rate = 1e-4.
- Composite loss:

\[
\mathcal{L} = 0.5\,\mathcal{L}_{BCE} + 0.5\,\mathcal{L}_{Dice}
\]

Dice term (from probabilities) is:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{Dice}=1-\frac{2\sum_i p_i g_i + \epsilon}{\sum_i p_i + \sum_i g_i + \epsilon}
\]

Best checkpoint is selected by validation Dice. Ensemble training freezes base models and optimizes only ensemble-head parameters.

---

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

For each model and the ensemble, compute:

- Dice score,
- Intersection-over-Union (IoU),
- Precision,
- Recall,
- Accuracy.

Definitions (TP/FP/FN/TN pixel-wise):

\[
\text{Dice} = \frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}
\]
\[
\text{IoU} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP + FN}
\]
\[
\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP},\;
\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN},\;
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}
\]

Additionally, report:

- Total and trainable parameter counts,
- Throughput (FPS) measured with warmup and timed inference loops.

## 7. Reproducibility and Engineering Controls

1. Fixed random seeds across Python/NumPy/PyTorch.
2. Unified preprocessing and split logic for all models.
3. Shape normalization utility to guarantee binary BCHW outputs.
4. Robust checkpoint loader that:
   - loads only key/shape-matching tensors,
   - skips incompatible tensors,
   - logs loaded/skipped layer summaries.
5. Debug prints for tensor I/O shapes at first forward pass.

These controls reduce experimental variance and prevent silent shape/configuration failures.

## 10. Discussion Points for PhD Writing

1. **Why standardization matters**: architecture-level gains are obscured when preprocessing differs.
2. **Error modes**: small-flat polyps, specular highlights, blurred boundaries, stool artifacts.

   - TransFuse: improved global-context sensitivity,
   - WDFFNet: feature diversity via dual-backbone fusion and attention.
4. **Why ensemble improves generalization**: adaptive weighting mitigates model-specific failure modes.
5. **Limitations**: dataset size, single-dataset evaluation, possible domain shift across hospitals/devices.
6. **Future work**: cross-dataset validation, uncertainty estimation, semi-supervised learning, test-time adaptation.

## 11. Example Methodology Paragraph (Ready to paste)

> We implemented a unified segmentation framework in PyTorch for Kvasir-SEG using ResUNet++, TransFuse, and WDFFNet under identical preprocessing conditions (512×512 resize and ImageNet normalization). Each model was trained independently with a balanced Dice-BCE objective and Adam optimization (1e-4), selecting checkpoints by best validation Dice. To leverage model complementarity, we introduced a learnable weighted ensemble that freezes base networks and estimates adaptive per-pixel fusion weights via a lightweight softmax head. Evaluation was performed on a held-out test split using Dice, IoU, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy, supplemented with computational profiling (parameter counts and FPS). This design ensures architectural fairness, reproducibility, and robust comparative analysis for medical image segmentation.
